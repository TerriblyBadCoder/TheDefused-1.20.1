This is uh... A mod, it adds some neat stuff to (currently) 3,5 areas of the game:
1. End transmutation: items thrown in the void now float out, some will even change.
2. Creeper defusion: you can lobotomise creepers with shears.
3.5 Bombs: Charged creepers now drop special ashes
4. Guardian eyes: Used to make potions and an observer variant
